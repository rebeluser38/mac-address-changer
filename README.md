# MAC-address-SPOOFING
In this Repository I'll be practising and let you know about how to change one's device MAC address.

#  FOREMOST LETS UNDERSTAND WHAT DOES THIS MAC address means to us.
A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique hardware identifier assigned to a network interface, used within local networks to identify devices. 
Spoofing a MAC address allows us to mask our actual device identity for privacy, security testing, or bypassing simple network restrictions.


# Why do we need to Spoof our MAC Address?
Ethical reasons include:
Privacy: which Prevent tracking based on our physical address on public networks.(usually when we are on public or untrusted router)
Bypass MAC Filters: Some networks restrict access by MAC addresses; spoofing can be used during authorized security testing to evaluate network security.(usually happens when an individual mac address id blocked)
Security Testing: Used in penetration tests to simulate attacks or test defenses.
